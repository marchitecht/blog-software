    "postContent1": "The project I worked on is related to a factory that manufactures fully integrated weighbridge systems. The most fascinating aspect of interacting with the client is understanding what they want to see in the end product. One of the main features of the application is 24/7 weight monitoring through a mobile app.",
    "postContent2": "We have created a unique environment that enables customers to identify when and where malfunctions occur in the weighing system. To achieve this, we developed 24 functions logically grouped into three categories for easy navigation.",
    "heading2": "Big idea",
    "postContent3": "One of the interesting implementations in the project is a 3D visualization model. Initially, the client provided a weighbridge model in .usdz format for viewing in augmented reality. We came up with the idea of transferring this model to a web platform, adding various functions and animations to it.",
    "postContent4": "To achieve this, I used three.js and other React libraries for 3D work. Optimizing the 3D models proved to be a separate crucial task, where we dealt with various aspects such as polygon count and texture scaling.",

    "postContent6": "One of the key features of this application is displaying the operation of load cells on the 3D model. If a load cell is in a normal state, it is highlighted in green, but if there are issues, it is highlighted in red.",
    "postContent7": "Afterward, a new task emerged: to make the model and specific load cells visually accessible to the client. Instead of complicating things and using libraries like Theatre.js, I decided to write everything in useEffect, and it worked :)",
    "postContent8": "First, I check which device my client is using. Here is the current state:"
